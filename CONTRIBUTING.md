# Introduction

### Welcome to ballmers peak calculator repo!

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Ballmers Peak Calculator.

# Ground Rules

 * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
 * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution
To get started you can look at the project's current issues. Some issues may be labelled with good first issue or other beginner specific labels. These are issues perfect for a beginner for this project.

 Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
 Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

# Getting started
### How to submit a contribution

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request with your changes.


# How to report a bug
 When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

 1. What version of React and node are you using?
 2. What browser are you using?
 3. What did you do?
 4. What did you expect to see?
 5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
 If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
